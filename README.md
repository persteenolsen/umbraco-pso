My Personal Website by Umbraco 13 CMS and a MSSQL Database

# Create a global json

dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 8.0.203 --force

# Functionality of the Website

- Simple Web Application with an Umbraco Backend

# Tech used for creating the Website

- .NET 8
- Umbraco 13 CMS
- MSSQL Database for both Development and Production
- A traditional Webhotel for hosting
- VS Code

# Development

dotnet run

# Production

Create a self contained build for production at the remote server / traditionel web hotel

dotnet publish psoumbraco.csproj --configuration Release --runtime win-x86 --self-contained

Upload the build to remote server

At my remote servers the web.config needs to be without the folowing:

hostingModel="inprocess"

# Settings for Production

Login to your Umbraco and perform a Health Check under Settings

Open your web.config file at your Web hotel and be aware of the Excessive Headers that:

- Could be revealing information in its headers that gives away unnecessary details about the technology used to build and host

- Add code to web.config which contains:

- httpProtocol - customHeaders - remove - name=X-Powered-By

- security - requestFiltering - RemoveServerHeader=true

Take a look in file Program.cs and the code about security by the HTTP Headers:

- Click-Jacking Protection

- Content / MIME Sniffing Protection

- Cookie hijacking and protocol downgrade attacks Protection

Go to appsettings.json and make sure that your Umbraco Site have the settings:

- Hosting:Debug:false

- UseHTTPS:true

- WebRouting:UmbracoApplicationUrl:your.domain.com

- Go to PsoUmbraco . csproj and enable the ItemGroup / compile

Note: Also check your settings in appsettings.Development.json for

- Hosting:Debug

# Sync your remote Prod changes to your local Dev

- Open web.config and save - This is a work around for stop / start the app pool

- The MSSQL Database works for both Development and Production

- Download Views, media files or whatever files that you worked with at Prod

# Models Builder - Configuration - Tips and Tricks

Be sure that the Models for the Document Types are available and Recognized in VS Code:

- Take a look at the settings for ModelsBuilder in appsetting.Development

- Make sure to create the folder: umbraco / models to match the "ModelsDirectory": "~/umbraco/models"

- Make sure you have the setting: "ModelsMode": "SourceCodeManual" for generate the .cs files

- Make a dotnet build and then dotnet run and open the Admin Section of your site which will work even the site will not work before the models will be generated !!!

- Go to the Models Builder in the Admin Section of your site and click: Regenerate Models

- Take a look in the folder: umbraco / models where the .cs files / models were created by VS Code

- Stop your site and make a dotnet run to see your site is running

- Note: The cs files / models must be ignored before Release Build / Production. This must be doing manually in the ItemGroup / compile in the PsoUmbraco . csproj !!!

Happy use Umbraco :-)
